        Do you ever sit back to relax and get torn between whether to spend your evening with a group of friends or simply chill at your couch listening to your playlist ?
        Well, pull up your socks for this new adventure where we serve you the best of both worlds.
        <br>
        ‘The Playlist Game’ is a perfect amalgamation of your favourite songs with the punch of game night.
        <br>
        The major theme of the game is ‘mystery’.
        <br>
        Each player has to provide unique songs from their playlists which is kept as a secret. As soon as the game starts a song will be played and all contestants have to figure out to whom does the song belong. The owner of the song has to defend himself by bluffing other players. The person within maximum score wins the game.
